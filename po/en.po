The model number (e.g. \"1800+\") will be the rating off of\nwhich you should determine the system's inclusion into a given\nspec, and should therefore also be the number written on the\ncase tag.  Ask somebody what this means if these instructions\nare not clear.\n\nMake sure that this info fits within the specifications of the\nbox that you are building.\n\nIt is expected that the bogomips rating is close to twice the\ncpu MHz rating, so we are sure that the cpu is not damaged.  If\nthe bogomips rating is low, call over your friendly build\ninstructor."
