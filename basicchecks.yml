tests: 
  checkCdromDrive: 
    command: /usr/lib/freegeek_show_cd_drives
    title: "Checking status of CD ROM:"
    explanation: |-
      The output should contain reference to a CD ROM and possibly a
      DVD ROM which should each show up as one of scd? or sg?.
      If not, it is likely cabled or jumpered incorrectly.
      NOTE: The CD ROM may not show up in BIOS. This is not a
      problem.
  checkHardDrive: 
    command: "#$DMESG | egrep '[hs]d[a-z]'"
    title: "Checking status of hard drive:"
    explanation: |-
      This command is showing information corresponding to the
      harddrive that has been installed in this system, and each line
      should include 'sda'.  If this is not true, the
      harddrive is improperly jumpered or installed.  Shut down the
      computer and rejumper the drive.  Otherwise, make sure the size
      is correct.
  checkNetwork: 
    title: "Checking networking:"
    test: "system(\"ping -c 1 #$SERVER\")"
    explanation: |-
      This command tests communication over the network by requesting
      a simple message be sent back from our build server.
    fallback_command: sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart
    success: Networking seems to work.
    failure: |-
      Networking is not responding.  Your network card may be broken
      or misconfigured.
  checkSound: 
    command: aplay /usr/share/sounds/alsa/Front_Left.wav /usr/share/sounds/alsa/Front_Right.wav
    title: "Checking sound:"
    pretest: |-
      A sound is about to play.  Please make sure the speakers are
      plugged in and on, with the volume set to ~50%.
    explanation: |-
      A sound should have played just now at an audible level without
      distortion.
      
      If a sound did not play, the speakers may be plugged into the
      wrong port or may not be turned on.
      
      If error messages were displayed, the sound card may not be
      physically installed, properly configured or it may be bad
      hardware.
      
      If the sound was too quiet, try using the 'alsamixer' command to
      adjust the volume levels, setting "Master" and "PCM" to ~90 each.
      
      If the sound is distorted, turn down the volume in both
      'alsamixer' and on the speakers, or decide that the speakers are
      bad.
  checkCpuInfo: 
    title: "Checking CPU info:"
    commands: 
    - grep 'model name' /proc/cpuinfo
    - grep 'cpu MHz' /proc/cpuinfo
    - grep 'bogomips' /proc/cpuinfo
    - cpufreq-info -l | cut -d ' ' -f 2 | sed -r -e 's/^/Maximum CPU MHz ; /' -e 's/([0-9]{3})$/.\\1/'
    explanation: |-
      cpu MHz or model number* should match what was written on the
      label on the case. If it does not you must stop and figure out
      why.
      
      * For various AMD chips, the model name will differ from the
      MHz.  The model number (e.g. "1800+") will be the rating off of
      which you should determine the system's inclusion into a given
      spec, and should therefore also be the number written on the
      case tag.  Ask somebody what this means if these instructions
      are not clear.
      
      Make sure that this info fits within the specifications of the
      box that you are building.
      
      It is expected that the bogomips rating is close to twice the
      cpu MHz rating, so we are sure that the cpu is not damaged.  If
      the bogomips rating is low, call over your friendly build
      instructor.
  checkVideoResolution: 
    command: xdpyinfo -display :0 | grep dimen
    title: "Checking video resolution:"
    explanation: |-
      This is the number of pixels displayed on the screen.  For
      usability purposes, this should be set to 1024x768 or larger (i.e., 1280x1024).
      If it is smaller than this, your video display is probably
      misconfigured. Read through the instructions at:
      http://wiki.freegeek.org/index.php/Build_tips
      under the "Video" section to fix this.
      
      If the resolution is larger, it is ok as long as you can read
      it.
  checkMemory: 
    command: "free -m | egrep '^Mem' | awk '{print $2}'"
    title: "Checking amount of memory:"
    explanation: |-
      The value should be close to the number of megabytes of memory
      you have installed in this system.  It will typically be a
      bit smaller (e.g. 502 for a 512 megabyte system).
